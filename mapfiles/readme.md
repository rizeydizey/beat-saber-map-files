i've genuinely just dumped the files in here, they're not supposed to be fancy.

each noodlemap will include a "about" file talking about the map, probably not in depth because there's not a lot to say tbh (unless there is idk)

i also dont have the map files for balls in yo jaw, yet there is nothing special about that map so you can just download it yourself

i also am not posting old maps here or unpublished maps
