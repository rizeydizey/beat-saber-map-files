# my beat saber map files :3
### READ LAST PARAGRAPH AT LEAST.
## dumping these on my GitHub because I have to reset my laptop sometimes, and hey maybe someones interested on how I did something


***also, i am a very intermediate mapper and modhcarter, none of these are probably going to be high quality, and the noodle files are probably going to be messy.***



# these are not for taking, i am uploading these for my own personal use, and for new noodlers to understand how something works, or for people wanting the raw files of my maps (if any). please don't steal effects or a chroma environment (like the one in Super Idol) for your own map.
